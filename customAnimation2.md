# Custom Animation

This is my first time dealing with open source projects. I added an animation similar to one that existing in the app.

I created a **CUSTOM ANIMATION2** animation. When the user clicks on it the animation start sliding in from the bottom and sliding out to the top.

To do that I created two `.xml` files, the first one is for **slid_in_bottom.xml** and the second one is **slid_out_bottom.xml**.
